                        Various parameters regarding the simulation can be tweaked using the inputs above.
                        "Debug", when turned on, renders the view radii and attraction / repulsion parameters for each agent.
                        These graphics are colour-coded, green being for food, red for poison and blue for agents. If a circle (view radius) is highlit,
                        that indicates that the given agent has detected an entity of that type in its view radius.

                        This simulates the evolution of a species as they adapt to their environment. Said species is made up
                        of steering agents; vehicles which have a velocity, position and steering mechanics according to what
                        they are currently seeking. This steering behaviour is governed by 2 parameters - the view radius of the
                        vehicle, and its attraction to a spotted entity. This attraction can be either positive or negative - 
                        positive drawing the agent towards the entity, and negative doing the opposite. There are three types of
                        entities in this world: food, poison and agents, all of which have unique parameter pairings in an agent.
                        <br><br>
                        Evolution is simulated by having an initial randomly generated population, and then having a small
                        chance for them to reproduce asexually every frame. Eating food prolongs the lifespan of an agent, whereas
                        eating poison decreases their lifespan. Hence, rather than having an explicit fitness function as is common
                        to most genetic algorithms, this simulation uses a pseudo-fitness-function which dictates that the longer an
                        agent survives, the more likely it is to reproduce (according to the laws of probability).
                        <br><br>
                        When an agent creates an offspring, this offspring inherits its 'DNA' from the parent, and every gene in this DNA has a 
                        small chance of mutation during reproduction. Hence, natural selection is emulated. One problem with this simulation is that
                        the initial population is admittedly too small, and so often the species simply dies out due to a lack of variety in genes
                        (or lack of agents with favourable genes). To solve this a larger world would need to be created, so that more agents could be
                        created initially without cramming them together.
